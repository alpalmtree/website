I used to be a translator.

I *used* to love being a translator. I always dreamt of translating great authors, novelists, poets and playwrights. That is, until I discovered that this kind of translation is extremely hard to get into and poorly paid. What really made me survive was a combination of customer service jobs and legal translation at 0.045 cents per word (if you know nothing about translation market, that is shit). And I could still consider myself fortunate because at least I wasn't reviewing puke generated by machine translation or AI.

Yet, the market seemed to be moving towards the machine translation. The technological advancements in the field were taking the fun part out of it.

Faster? Sure. Sometimes helpful? Yeah.

I hated everything about it.

I had to take part of a market I didn't like. With poorly paid people (me included), a huge precariousness and the demolishing feeling of knowing that not everything would be literature and beautiful things. On the contrary, most of the time would be the *ugly*. The *bad*. Mostly boring stuff that just get the bills paid but that at what price.

*Sounds familiar?*

## Transitioning to web development

Translation was (probably) one of the professions first affected by the (*proto*)AI. Nowadays, the translation market is even worse than when I left it. While there are still few people earning their life well with translation, day after day, we see people giving up. People with half their lives invested in this profession have to give up because capitalism is suffocating them.

Things are getting worse and worse, but there's still **hope**.

Among these beautiful human beings, we see people creating community. We see people creating healthy professional and emotional support networks where they help each other. Where they pride themselves to be humans. They pledge to honor the fair professional praxis and don't accept to be treated like shit － even if that means saying *no* to a much-needed gig.

They live through this hell with **dignity**.

We can learn from this.

In the era of AI, we must stand for the human. We must value the human work and take the artisanal approach when possible. We must stand with the planet － if we want future generations to have a planet.

Is programming something you do just for money? Do you believe that anything goes as long as it gets the job done? Congrats, I bet you live with an incredible peace of mind. You won't probably find anything helpful in this site.

For the rest of us: We must say **no** to haste, to half-baked software and to shipping something that will probably only work well with high-tech equipment, making people want to switch to more powerful hardware only because the apps we write aren't efficient enough.

While I might get a lot of things wrong, I'll share here ideas and thoughts about the web platform － to hopefully spark some ideas, to collect feedback, create a community to learn from and to contribute to.

Let us create something beautiful. Let us be a small resistance against the colossus of capitalism. Let us just enjoy code without any materialistic reason.

The internet is broken, but we can still fix it.
